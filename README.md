## `ICoM-MESH-DATA`

The "unified" multi-model meshing datasets.

### `Purpose`

This is an "archive" repository, designed to store any data, files, etc used by the main <a href="https://github.com/DOE-ICoM/icom-mesh">`ICoM-MESH`</a> workflows. Data is attached as "assets" to `ICoM-MESH-DATA` "releases", to be downloaded and unpacked using the <a href="https://github.com/DOE-ICoM/icom-mesh">`ICoM-MESH/extract.py`</a> utility. This workflow helps keep the main `ICoM-MESH` repository free of unecessary large binary data bundles.
